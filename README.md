# 8090-Inc Top Coder Response

This repository presents a machine learning-based approach for calculating travel reimbursements using trip duration, mileage, and receipt totals. The solution leverages XGBoost to model complex reimbursement patterns learned from historical data.

## Overview
Conventional rule-based reimbursement systems often fall short when handling the nuanced policies found in real-world scenarios. Attempts to reverse engineer such logic using GenAI lacked precision. This project replaces rigid conditional logic with a data-driven machine learning model capable of capturing subtle patterns and delivering accurate reimbursement estimates.
